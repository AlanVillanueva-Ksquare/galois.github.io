    <h3 style="text-align: center">Young mathematician (1811-1832)</h3>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">10 interesting facts about this surprisingly young scientist</h4>
    </hgroup>
    <ul>
      <li>Galois was born on October 25, 1811, in Bourg-la-Reine, France. His father was Nicolas-Gabriel Galois, a Republican who had fought in the French Revolution.</li>
      <li>Galois was a child prodigy in mathematics and was able to solve complex mathematical problems at a young age.</li>
      <li>He was expelled from the École Polytechnique, a prestigious engineering school in France, for his political activities and his rebellious behavior.</li>
      <li>Galois' work laid the foundations for modern abstract algebra, specifically the field which is named after him, Galois theory.</li>
      <li>He published only one paper during his lifetime, "Mémoire sur les conditions de résolubilité des équations par radicaux," which is now known as the Galois Theory.</li>
      <li>Galois' work was not well received by the academic community during his lifetime, and it was only after his death that his ideas were recognized and developed further by other mathematicians.</li>
      <li>He died in a duel at the age of 20, which some believe was politically motivated. His death cut short a promising mathematical career.  </li>
      <li>Galois' handwriting was notoriously difficult to decipher, which made it challenging for others to understand his ideas.  </li>
      <li>Despite his short life, Galois made significant contributions to several branches of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and analysis. </li>
      <li>Galois has had a significant influence on mathematics, and his work continues to be studied and applied in various fields, including cryptography, computer science, and physics.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 style="text-align: center">About his most popular contribution to mathematics</h3>
    <p>
      Hopefully, the reader is familiar with the formulae solving linear and cuadratic equations, the latter known as the quadratic formula. A bit more esoteric fact is that there is also a formula solving cubic equations and another one solving degree four equations. Naturally, that lead us to think no matter the degree of the equation, we will always be able to find its solutions through a formula. Turns out, this is not true as first stated by a young norwegian mathematician. What does this has to do with Galois? Actually, he made his own proof about this fact and even went one step further. While not every high degree equation has a formula solving it, some particular cases have one and he completely described this type of equation. The methods developed for doing such proof are what we call Galois Theory. As a summary of this contribution put in just a few words, we are, in general, not able to solve equations of degree beyond four by formula.
